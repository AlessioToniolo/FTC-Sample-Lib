# FTC-Sample-Lib
FTC library for First Tech Challenge Ultimate Goal teams based off of external FTC samples

## Welcome
This library is intended for use with OnBotJava, as it is intended to be very simple to use for beginner teams. Enjoy!

### Format
Usually you would find FTC code in an Android Studio project, but since this code does not use any external libraries you do need the gradle files along with the robot controller and teamcode folder since their is no practical use in using Android Studio for this type of project.
